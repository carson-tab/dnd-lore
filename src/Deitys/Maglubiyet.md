### Background

Deity of the [[goblin|goblins]].
Worshiped by a complex hierarchy of Shamans who rule the [[goblin]] tribes.
[[Maglubiyet]] and his [[goblin|goblins]] and [[bugbear|bugbears]] had been locked in a centuries long war against [[Grummsh]] and his [[orc|orcs]].  Finally a peace was reached between the dietys in the [[Treaty of Gidale]], which declared [[Gidale]] the western most settlement of [[goblin|goblins]].
