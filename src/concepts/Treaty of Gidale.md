### Background

After centuries of war between [[goblin|goblins]] and [[orc|orcs]], the gods [[Maglubiyet]] and [[Grummsh]] made a truce.  It was declared that [[Gidale]] would be the western most [[goblin]] settlement.  [[orc|Orcs]] must remain west of [[Gidale]] and [[goblin|goblins]] cannot travel west of [[Gidale]].  The truce held for nearly 300 years.

With [[half-orc|half-orcs]] in the [[Covenant of the Red Knight|Red Army]] entering [[Gidale]] as part of its joining the [[Covenant of the Red Knight]], [[Maglubiyet]] felt [[Grummsh]] had broken the treaty and a new war was inevitable.  [[Maglubiyet]] ordered his shamans to deliver a key to the [[goblin vault]] to [[Copper Squad]] in order to flood the [[Covenant of the Red Knight|Red Army]] with [[cursed goblin gold]] to be sent to [[Foedopolis]].
