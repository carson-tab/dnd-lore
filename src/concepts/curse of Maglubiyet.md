###### Background
[[Maglubiyet]] god of the [[goblin|goblins]] has long believed that money and gold were obstacles to the cohesion of [[goblin]] society.  As such all followers of [[Maglubiyet]] feel a deep discomfort for gold. This discomfort is so strong, it can become painful if a follower so much as touches gold.  [[goblin]] society, accepting this directive from their god, built large underground vaults and placed all their gold inside.  Knowing that these vaults full of gold would be a tempting target for those who do not worship [[Maglubiyet]], [[goblin]] shamans placed a curse upon the gold, the [[curse of Maglubiyet]].

###### Becoming Cursed
Any non-goblinoid becomes cursed by the [[curse of Maglubiyet]] by touching any [[cursed goblin gold]].

###### Effects of Curse
Everyday a non-goblinoid suffering from [[curse of Maglubiyet]] rolls a CON saving throw, eventually resulting in the person becoming a [[goblin]] in 5-20 days.  Once a goblin [[Maglubiyet]] has some power over them.  Ultimately , however, they must choose to commit themselves fully to [[Maglubiyet]] and embrace their newfound [[goblin]] identity of their own free will to become a subject of [[Maglubiyet]].

###### Curing the Curse
There are several ways to lift the curse.
1. Remove curse: cast on the effected person will lift the curse, however, if the person touches [[cursed goblin gold]] again, the curse will start again.
2. Consuming a [[green potion]]: by consuming a [[green potion]] and making a pact with a demon or devil, the curse is lifted and the consumer cannot be cursed again while in the pact.
3. Returning the [[cursed goblin gold]] which was touched to the goblin vault: lifts the curse on all who touched the gold, however, if a person touches [[cursed goblin gold]] again, the curse will start again.
