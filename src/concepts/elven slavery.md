An early leader of the lands, [[Sir Oatmeal]], had a strong grudge against elves for capturing him.  When he took power in the lands which would later become [[Foedopolis]], he enslaved the [[elf|elves]].

[[elf|elves]] remained as low status creatures for many years.  It was not until the formation of the [[Covenant of the Red Knight]] and it's mission to unite all humanoids against the forces which commonly threaten them all that [[elven slavery]] was ended.  [[Covenant of the Red Knight]] believes that [[elven slavery]] created divisions in society which weakened humanoid kind's ability to defend itself from outside forces, such as [[Golgari]] and demons.
