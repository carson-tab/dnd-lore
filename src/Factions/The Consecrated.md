### Background

The chosen members of the [[Sleepy Slavers]].
Past members include [[Stolas]], [[Fane]], and [[Stripes]].
Current members include [[Vortexiax]], [[Gobz]], and [[Kraggly]].

### Abilities

Members of [[The Consecrated]] have the ability to 
1. Faintly Glow Purple - Free
2. Swap places with one other person
3. 3. Temporarily remove party member from existence and bring them back via purple mist (one cursed/blessed person must remain)
4. 4. Swap health pools. Does not apply to temporary HP. If swapping health causes someone to go above their maximum, reduce it to your maximum (i.e. can't go above max health). Works even when at 0 hp.
5. 5. Temporarily remove willing creature outside of the party from existence and bring them back via purple mist. They can stay in mist and sense through the party to decide when they want to leave. If unwilling, it's a CON save DC 10 per turn at BEGINNING of their turn (they get rest of the turn). Only one person at a time. Creature reappear where they want if they're willing, if they resist they emerge randomly next to a random party member

All actions can happen for free at any time, no action cost (although damage only ticks once per turn, but can only do once per round)
