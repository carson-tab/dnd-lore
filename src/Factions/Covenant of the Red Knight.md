 After surviving attacks by Demons and [[Golgari]], many great warriors established a new world government with hopes of uniting all the world's humanoids. Many regions have sent representatives to the seat of government in [[Foedopolis]]. The Government in [[Foedopolis]] has brought common alliance and common law to the land. No longer will the people of The [[Covenant of the Red Knight]] live in fear of war.

Rumors spread of [[Golgari]] destroying entire villages and even cities. Each dead city, rising up as sporulated zombies, ready to add to Golgari ranks. Many questions remain about the massive destruction wrought by Demons in [[Totally Not Japan]]. Fear and paranoia saturated the lands. The Covenant provides a beacon of light in an otherwise dismal world. 

The [[Covenant of the Red Knight|Red Knight's Army]] united after the Demons' destruction of [[Totally Not Japan]]. They have begun a radical transformation of the societies that join them. Under the red banner, the army abolished [[Elven slavery]]. No longer may corrupt tyrants restrict the flow of information or technology. When called upon, any institution must serve The Covenant's needs for the good of all humanoid-kind.

Regions that agree to join The Covenant join their collective political body. Members of The Covenant agree to a shared army. Members share resources, technology, and information without borders or limitations.  The pluralistic society of The Covenant include [[human]], [[orc]], [[dwarf]], [[tiefling]], [[gnome]], [[goblin]], and even [[elf]]. Members are free to worship, rule, and live as they see fit. Members are required to supply representatives, soldiers, and taxes to [[Foedopolis]].  In exchange, The Covenant provides well-trained and well-equipped soldiers to maintain law and order.  The Covenant allows autonomy for localities but will crack down where common principles are not followed. This has meant The [[Covenant of the Red Knight|Red Army]] hunts bandits, slavers, Demons, and killers.

The ultimate goal of The Covenant of The Red Knight is to unite all humanoids. Only a union of humanoids with common interests will bring peace and protection to the lands.
