### City Background

In a great plane with few spots of forest lays [[Gidale]]. Although it may not look like much, this town is home to many mighty [[goblin|goblins]]. The streets are dense with masses of goblins moving every which way. Children play and sign on the cobblestone streets while adults seem hard at work. Large carts carrying stones are wheeled by oxen into the town one after another. [[human|Humans]] and [[orc|orcs]] in [[Covenant of the Red Knight|red]] armor watch the carts as they pass. The stones are beginning to construct a wall around the town. Although only the walls bones are currently in place. Above all the crowds in the streets, a few large buildings loom overhead; most ominous, a tall narrow building is topped with a massive black double sided axe.
