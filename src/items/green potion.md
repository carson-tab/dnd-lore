###### Background

This potion is made from materials found in [[goblin]] territory and has a long history among their tribes.  It is outlawed by all tribes governed by [[Maglubiyet]]'s shamans.  [[goblin|Goblin]] tribes make tremendous efforts to prevent the spread of this item.

###### Effects

This powerful potion knocks the consumer unconscious. While unconscious the consumer travels a dream realm of demons and devils.  In order to regain consciousness, they must agree to a pact with a demon or devil. 

Consuming this potion and maintaining a pact makes one immune from [[curse of Maglubiyet]].

For each potion consumed, gain a level of warlock.
