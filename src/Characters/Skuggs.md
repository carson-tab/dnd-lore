### Background

What can really be said of [[Skuggs]] background? Where did they come from? In some ways [[Skuggs]] is not even a person at all but a force of nature.  They are a warlock with abilities granted from [[Guglax]] in exchange to be [[Guglax]]'s chaotic killing machine.  [[Skuggs]]'s natural charm along with their ability to perfectly match the look and voice of any medium sized humanoid made them nearly impossible to recognize as [[Skuggs]].  

### Major Events

Under the guidance of [[Guglax]], [[Skuggs]] killed their way through [[Totally Not Japan]].  Whether [[Skuggs]] or the [[demon invasion of Totally Not Japan]] took more lives is still widely debated.
