### Background

[[Kraggly|Kraggly Smackers]] was born in the outskirts of [[Belarrak|Belarakk]]. His family were dairy farmers and made a decent living. From an early age he showed wisdom beyond his years. [[Kraggly|Kraggs]] soon found himself studying and practicing at the nearby monastery, where Helm first spoke to him in his dreams. Over the next 30 years he had recurring dreams wherein [[Helm]] told him to join the [[Sleepy slavers]] and fight the incoming threat. 

[[Kraggly|Kraggs]] joined the [[Covenant of the Red Knight|Red Knights]] at 25 years of age and fought in many battles. He requested to be stationed in his hometown of Belarakk and settled down with a wife and three kids. They have a small place in the forest outside of town, living relatively secluded but peaceful lives.
