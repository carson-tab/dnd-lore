### Background

Once a child living with his mother in an inn in [[New Dawn]], he was inspired upon meeting the heroes of [[The Consecrated]]. He wished to prove his bravery to [[Vortexiax]] and joined their party. During a dangerous journey crossing from [[Sunset Point]] to [[Gretmark Harbor]], the party's ship was attacked by a [kraken](https://2014.5e.tools/bestiary.html#kraken_mm).  Kevin tried to show his bravery by fighting and was near death.  He was saved by divine intervention. [[Surtur]] turned [[Kevin]] into a [Iron Golem](https://2014.5e.tools/bestiary.html#iron%20golem_mm), saving his life.  After some time [[Surtur]] further blessed [[Kevin]] by giving him the power of speech via [Thaumaturgy](https://2014.5e.tools/spells.html#thaumaturgy_phb)
