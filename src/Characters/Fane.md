### Background

A member of [[The Astonishing Resolution]] and once one of the chosen among [[Sleepy Slavers]].
He has a long standing grudge against the [[Covenant of the Red Knight]] due to an attack on his mission in [[Totally Not Japan]]. He is bound by a magic ring to serve [[Algrag]].

### Major Events

After being freed from the captivity of the [[Covenant of the Red Knight|Red Army]] in [[Foedopolis]], [[Fane]] began to search for [[The Astonishing Resolution]]. His search brought him to [[Willowbottom]] where he was attacked by [[Calumir]], who placed a curse upon him, [[Stolas]], and [[Stripes]].  They became the [[Sleepy Slavers]] on account of the sleep spell which [[Calumir]] used to make them vulnerable to the curse.

He was never trusting of [[Calumir]].

He wanted to become a better person and learn honor and morality. When convicted of a crime in [[Haven]], he accepted his punishment and was put to death.
