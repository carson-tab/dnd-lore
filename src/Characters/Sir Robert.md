### Background

Devout follower of [[The Red Knight]]. Stern leader of [[Covenant of the Red Knight|Red Army]] troops.

### Major Events

Turned into a [[goblin]] by [[curse of Maglubiyet]].

Due to a long history of war between [[orc]] and [[goblin]], [[Sir Robert]] does not enjoy becoming a [[goblin]] and declares this a hostile action from the shamans of [[Maglubiyet]] and an act of war.  

[[Sir Robert]] leads factional divide among the [[Covenant of the Red Knight]], who paint over their red symbols in black.  This faction believes the [[curse of Maglubiyet]] was an act of war by the [[goblin|goblins]] and should be treated as such.

After confronting [[Bhaaft]] in the Temple of [[Maglubiyet]] in [[Gidale]] about [[curse of Maglubiyet]], the shamans and the Black Knight faction battled and [[Sir Robert]] was slain.
