The kingdom of [[Rhodonia]] is south of [[Chak-Tha Desert]].
The Rhodonians have a tepid peace with the [[Covenant of the Red Knight]] due to separation by the desert. Recently, the Rhodonians have made military expeditions into Red Knight territory in search of a criminal, [[Stolas]].  The search has caused clashes with the [[Covenant of the Red Knight]] but a new peace is in place... how long will it last?
